<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Jack Vance's Demon Princes series follows the far-future exploits of
Kirth Gersen on a quest for revenge that spans a huge swath of our
galaxy. Along the way, the reader will encounter thrilling adventure,
ornate worldbuilding, and logical deduction befitting Doyle but will
also at times struggle to make it through to the better parts. The
series consists of the novels The Star King, The Killing Machine, The
Palace of Love, The Face, and The Book of Dreams.</p>
<p>In a tale that mirrors spaghetti western Death Rides a Horse, Gersen is
one of only a few survivors of a raid known as the Mt. Pleasant
Massacre. The episode leaves him in the care of his grandfather, and the
perpetrators are the Demon Princes, five notorious outlaws. Gersen
spends his adolescence in dedicated training to become the deadliest man
in the known universe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-plot">
<h2>The Plot</h2>
<p>Each novel follows a similar formula. Gersen picks up the trail of one
of the Demon Princes, narrows down the outlaw's identity, embarks on a
doomed love affair, and sets in motion the circumstances for his
quarry's demise.&nbsp;All are plotted like&nbsp;detective stories, of which Vance
was a prodigious writer under the name John Holbrook Vance. The narrator
shifts from worldbuilding to sleuthing and back again, and in these
modes the novels excel. Scenes where characters interact are more
awkward and melodramatic. The reader may expect and excuse these
blemishes in works of this genre, but even the action scenes
occasionally fail. Fights and chases often end before they can really
get going, and the final encounters with the Princes tend toward
anticlimax.</p>
<p>While Gersen succeeds in engineering the final punishment for each of
his charges, he rarely delivers their just desserts directly, often
frustrating him and possibly the reader as well. The latter depends on
the reader's tolerance for the sacrifice of catharsis for purposes of
theme. Vance reaches for loftier heights than his subject matter would
normally allow for. He strains to answer some nagging existential
questions, but in the end this isn't that kind of series.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-prose">
<h2>The Prose</h2>
<p>The reader can see further evidence of Vance's aspirations in his use of
language. He pays far more attention to the way he writes than the
typical genre writer. Despite this, the language in Vance's work is of
mixed quality. At his best, Vance's prose is lyrical and moving, at
his&nbsp;worst pedantic and purple. The narration in The Star King in
particular suffers from an almost pathological dedication to the
thesaurus. In any case, reading through the Demon Princes saga offers a
rare glimpse into the evolution of an author.</p>
<p>This is partly due to one important peculiarity regarding the release of
the series. The first three novels came out within a span of three
years, but there is a twelve-year gap before the fourth. Between these
two sets of novels is a stark difference in style. Vance's later prose
is comparatively lean, the work of a grandmaster. Depending on your
tastes he may not compare with the great prose stylists, but weighed
against most science fiction of the era, the language is a treat. He
uses his way with words to tell us much about Gersen's world but
surprisingly little about the man himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-characters">
<h2>The Characters</h2>
<p>Jack Rawlins calls Kirth Gersen Vance's &quot;best developed character.&quot; In a
way, he may be right, but this isn't much cause for praise. Gersen grows
slowly over the passage of time, and his characterization is largely
static. The man has no dreams, aspirations, or interests beyond revenge
and the art of killing. Explications of attributes become rote: Gersen
is logical and determined, the word fanatic is used; he has an
occasional moment of ennui and lapses in dedication due to lust at least
once per novel. In his wooing of lovers the reader sees some evolution.
He goes from being relatively inexperienced to a regular lothario. Women
are drawn to his air of mystery and danger, naturally. This aspect of
the character largely serves male wish-fulfillment, though that's to be
expected in this kind of story.</p>
<p>What may surprise the&nbsp;reader is the repeated reference to sexual
assault, in one form or another, again and again throughout the series.
What should be clear about Vance's treatment of adult themes is that it
is rarely graphic. The violence is rather subdued, with quick flashes of
brutality, and sex is only alluded to, never described. Sexual assault,
however, appears in each novel, though again only referenced.</p>
<p>This tendency goes back to The Dying Earth, and in the Demon Princes it
manifests in every possible clich√©, including Gersen rescuing his
paramour from being raped only to quickly consummate their relationship.
Not all of the women in his life are so lucky. His treatment of this
subject dates the novels, but it is the frequency of its occurrence that
is most tiring. One might suspect the device's intention is to vilify
the Demon Princes, yet in reality they never directly partake in such
base acts. In fact, despite their obvious faults, they remain the most
interesting characters, certainly far more intriguing than the stolid
Gersen or his paper-thin and disposable lovers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-princes">
<h2>The Princes</h2>
<p>It is not merely the allure of the villain that makes the Princes
enthralling. Neither is it the palpable mystery that surrounds them,
though this certainly helps. The reader is offered snatches of
information as Gersen probes deeper into what makes these malicious
marauders tick. The least fascinating example are the first two:
Malagate the Woe and Kokor Hekkus.</p>
<p>Malagate has a fascinating origin and motivation: a criminal mastermind
from a race of lawful aliens who is dedicated to proving his species
superior to humanity. Unfortunately, his inner workings are never
delved, leaving him a flat character. His true name isn't even
discovered. Likewise, the Star King race is absent from later novels.</p>
<p>The next prince is Kokar Hekkus, an immortal shapeshifter. Hekkus is
mercurial, ruthless, and devoted to the capture of one woman. He plays
elaborate and deadly games with the humans of a primitive world. His
true&nbsp;motivations and origin are never explored.</p>
<p>Vance doesn't really get going until the third prince, Viole Falushe,
and his Palace of Love. The truth behind him is more terrible and better
developed than those previous. While a teenager, a girl spurns his
advances, so he kidnaps her. She continues to scorn him and dies, but he
clones her several times. Every girl is raised in a different
environment, each designed to engender devotion to him.</p>
<p>Despite the fourth novels' other virtues, the villain in The Face is not
terribly complex. In some ways, he is the reverse of the Star King.
Human but of offshoot genetic stock, he's an outcast, too corrupt for a
planet known for its lax morals. The true villain here&nbsp;is classism, and
here we see Gersen develop a bit in reaction to it as well as find
common ground with a Demon Prince.</p>
<p>It is in the final novel's Howard Alan Treesong, however, that we come
upon a creature most inventive and dangerous, and certainly with the
grandest designs. Howard has a similar history to Viole Falushe, an
unpopular&nbsp;but sensitive boy twisted to depravity. Obsessed with his own
fantasy word, written in his Book of Dreams, he might have the most in
common with the author of all his characters.</p>
<p>Overall, the reader learns more about and becomes more interested in the
Demon Princes than our protagonist and his cohorts. In general, what is
most worthwhile in Vance's novels is often the opposite of what is
expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-world">
<h2>The World</h2>
<p>Beyond the villains, it is Vance's rich and evocative worldbuilding that
primarily keeps the reader's interest, and his effortless skill in this
domain sets him apart from most writers working even today. Indeed, when
the plot lags or the seams of its formula show, it is always the
epigraphs and footnotes that reclaim the reader's attention. For one
novel Vance works&nbsp;out enough culture and geography to fill ten by an
average author. Each snippet is crafted with as much verve and
imagination as the last, and not once does it seem contrived.</p>
<p>One possible exception is the composition of planetary bodies. Here he
occasionally falls into genericity: the desert planet, the marsh planet,
the water planet, the jungle planet. And yet, he ameliorates this with
enough convincing technobabble and history that the reader can accept
the conceit. As such his skill in worldbuilding overshadows his other
talents.</p>
<p>&quot;The Oikumene&quot;, Vance's borrowing of an ancient Greek term, refers to
the civilized parts of the galaxy. Earth is a rarely visited part of it.
Instead, the hub of this series is Alphanor, though that world is
basically Earth by another name. The planets vary more, for
example&nbsp;Sarkoy, famous for its poisons which are feared on every planet,
and one unnamed Earthlike world populated by strange alien dryads. Much
of the narrative takes place outside the relatively safe confines of the
Oikumene, in the untamed frontier known as the Beyond.</p>
<p>Intrigue occurs&nbsp;between the two major organizations of the Oikumene: the
Interworld Police Coordinating Company and the Institute. Gersen is
involved with both. The philosophy of the latter in particular is
intriguing, and the reader may be frustrated by the many lacunae in its
description. We learn as much about the attitudes of the people in this
future society through excerpts from books on a variety of subjects,
including one book titled &quot;The Demon Princes.&quot; A literary figure that
appears with frequency is Unspiek, whose views are varied and
controversial.</p>
<p>Even geography is rigorously developed. Detailed descriptions of
locations and their layout betray no hint of artificiality. When
examined closely, they prove to be accurate and consistent, an
impressive feat considering the number of areas described. Likewise, the
histories of these worlds is developed through anecdote, though this at
times betrays Vance's biases. In one case, a colony of vegetarians
devolves into pale imbeciles, essentially grazing animals. In general,
the reader gets the sense that while Vance may not relish in violence,
he acclaims the strong over the weak, and considers conflict and
struggle necessary and beneficent attributes of the human condition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Demon Princes is not Vance's best work, but in the scope of these
novels we see him both at his best and his worst. In addition to them
being capable stories of their type, they offer a rare chronicle of a
writer's journey.</p>
