<p>to your reading list. Samuel Delany’s Dhalgren has achieved a reputation
for being daunting and difficult. A longtime Gene Wolfe aficionado, I
was not deterred by these warnings, though this was a book I read in
many sporadic sittings. As it turns out, Wolfe and Delany share much in
both theme and literary allusions. The short of it is that both authors
ponder the often hazy divide between the concrete and the abstract. &nbsp;Of
course, they have little in common politically, occupying opposite sides
of the political spectrum. At the same time, both writers were forged in
the heat of 70s and 80s speculative fiction, when writers were
experimenting with style and incorporating more epicurean literary
techniques into their “spacemen” stories.</p>
<p>To this end, Dhalgren’s plot eats at its own tail. Intimations of linear
progression mislead the reader at every turn of the page, but we
shouldn’t over-emphasize the plot. At its heart, this is a
character-driven novel. Its setting is one of these characters; the text
is another. The blurb on the back of my worn paperback tells me this
story takes place “at the end of time,” in a post apocalypse. This
explanation fails to satisfy. Essentially, Dhalgren is a metatextual
story told partially from the point-of-view of one nameless
partial-amnesiac (“the Kid”). These details suggest certain
philosophical antecedents.</p>
<p>Identity, perception, and text are unstable — according to
post-structural theory. In the book’s city of Bellonna, time and space
are likewise fractured. If you would like an objective explanation for
this, you will have to supply it yourself. The novel offers no easy
answers. I hesitate to call it science fiction as little science
occupies its exposition. The work is more reminiscent of Borges and
Barthelme than Asimov and Heinlein.</p>
<p>The novel’s literary gymnastics include meta- and intertextual
intricacies. For example, the Kid discusses relationship between
signifier and signified. This is elementary postmodern philosophy, and
yet it is the Kid’s inner struggle that resonated with me, struggles
with poetry, relationships, and finding his way in a hostile world. This
fascinating omnisexual, gangbanging, furniture-moving, homeless poet
warrants reading and will undoubtedly go down as one of the finest
characterizations in science fiction.</p>
<p>If this Mobius strip of an explication was invigorating rather than
daunting, then you should add this speculative fiction classic to</p>
